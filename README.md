# Linux Neo Qwertz XKB
This repository contains all needed files to add a keyboard layout to your linux distribution that closely resembles the Neo 2.0 layout on windows via autohotkey after pressing Capslock + F6 to enter Qwertz mode. The result is a layout that you can write mostly like on a normal qwertz layout but with the added adwantage, that you have all the extra 5 layers containing all the special caracters.
I personally use the programmers layer and the movement layer A LOT! And they are imensly timesaving and therewith valuable to me.
